Summary:
1. The program prompts the user to specify the number of bytes in memory, and the name of the input file.  
2. Program memory is then created based on the number of bytes specified by the user. 
3. Data from the input file is read, and processed based on the data type. 
4. Starting with the left most byte, bytes in memory are replaced as data values are read from the input file. 
5. The memory which was created is then displayed back to the user in a reader friendly format
